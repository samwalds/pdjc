## Welcome to the plasmodesmata and plant cell biology online journal club

This page will be built over the next few days to suite the purpose. Until then it will just be a draft and things may change and therefore are currently not the final versions. 
This is also my first attempt at building a github website, so please just ignore it until I publish it. 

## What is it?
2020 is turning out quite bleak in regards to conferences and other face-to-face opportunities to meet other people and network. Yes, seminar series are a nice accessible option, they are however not great to initate new personal connections. Online conferences are a nice addition to the networking repertoire, however they do require committment. Therefore the ideo of this journal club has been born.
We are planning to run this journal club initially on a monthly basis, and will see how it it develops with the input from all of you.

## How is this going to work?
Two main things: 
- An email list to recieve updates, about the next session(s)
- a seperate sign-up page/link for each session
If you have signed up for a session you'll recieve a confirmation email for it and in a timely manner (we are aiming for a few days before the actual event) you'll recieve a personalised zoom invitation link. 
Please do not share this link with anyone else, but rather encourage your colleagues to sign up individually.
